# transforms

Implementations of transforms between an unconstrained real vector and a point on the simplex for evaluation in the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) probabilistic programming language.

Currently you can sample the transforms in `transforms/simplex` directory using the scripts in `utils` and generate all the plots as well.
